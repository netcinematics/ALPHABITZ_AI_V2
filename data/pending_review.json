Measurement on one particle instantaneously actualizes the state of the entire system, leading to deterministically correlated outcomes for all constituent particles without superluminal information transfer.",
        "misnomer_analysis": {
            "common_usage": "Often understood as a 'tangle' or a 'link' that implies a direct physical connection or a mystical instantaneous influence ('spooky action at a distance') that suggests faster-than-light communication or information transfer between particles. The term 'entanglement' itself can evoke a sense of individual entities becoming physically intertwined or connected after the fact.",
            "scientific_reality": "Entanglement describes a *single, non-separable quantum state* that pertains to multiple particles from their moment of shared genesis or interaction. The particles do not individually possess definite properties until measured; rather, the *ensemble* is described by one wave function. A measurement on one particle instantaneously causes the entire shared wave function to collapse into a definite state, thereby correlating the outcomes of measurements on the other particles. This correlation is a manifestation of the pre-existing shared state, not a signal being sent or information being transferred between separate entities.",
            "correction": "A **Non-Local Quantum State Coherence** where multiple constituent quantum entities, originating from a common system genesis, exist as a single, indivisible probabilistic state whose constituent outcomes are instantaneously and deterministically correlated upon observation, without superluminal information transfer."

The scientific reality reveals that it's a *shared, indivisible quantum state* from which the particles emerge. This non-separability (non-decomposability) is key. The 'instantaneous influence' isn't communication, but rather the manifestation of a pre-existing correlation within this single state when an observation 'collapses' it. Thus, the lexical bits must reflect this: the *shared identity* (origin from one system), the *indivisibility* of their collective state, the *instantaneous nature* of state determination upon observation, and the *predictable correlation* of outcomes resulting from this shared state. The misnomer's focus on 'action' or 'link' is replaced by 'state coherence' and 'correlation enforcement' to describe the actual mechanism.",
